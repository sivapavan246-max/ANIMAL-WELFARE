            <h2>General Management and Prevention</h2>
            <p>
                Hygiene: Maintain clean living areas, especially around water troughs and milking parlors, to minimize the spread of soil-borne or bacterial infections.</br>
Vaccination: Follow a regular vaccination schedule for common diseases like Black Quarter and FMD, consulting with a local veterinarian for the appropriate vaccines and timing.</br>
Isolation: Isolate sick animals immediately to prevent the spread of contagious diseases to the rest of the herd.</br>
Nutrition: Ensure a balanced diet with adequate minerals and vitamins to maximize hoof health and boost immunity.</br>
Vector Control: Manage ticks, flies, and mosquitoes, as they can transmit diseases like Bluetongue, Anaplasmosis, and Babesiosis.</br>
Professional Consultation: For any serious or unusual signs of disease, contact a qualified veterinarian immediately.
