        <p>Common hen diseases include Coccidiosis, Marek's Disease, Fowl Pox, and Newcastle Disease, with symptoms ranging from diarrhea and lesions to paralysis and respiratory issues. Prevention involves strict hygiene and clean living conditions, while cures often require veterinary guidance, antibiotics, supportive care like hydration and warmth, and isolation of sick birds. For some issues like Fowl Pox, the disease may need to run its course with supportive care, or vaccination can be used for prevention. </p>

            <h2>General Management and Prevention</h2>
            <p>
*Maintain a clean coop: Regularly clean and disinfect the coop to prevent the buildup of bacteria, parasites, and other pathogens.</br>
*Provide a proper diet: Ensure your hens have a balanced diet and access to fresh water to boost their immune systems.</br>
*Quarantine new birds: Isolate any new birds for a few weeks to ensure they don't carry any diseases before introducing them to your flock.</br>
*Vaccinate: If you are in an area where specific diseases are common, consider vaccinating your flock against them.</br>
*Keep external parasites away: Regularly check for external parasites like mites and lice and treat them as needed.</br>
*Watch for external injuries: Protect hens from animal attacks, which can result in puncture wounds, and keep wounded birds isolated to prevent pecking from flock mates.</p>
