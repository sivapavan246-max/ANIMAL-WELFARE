        <p>Common cat diseases include upper respiratory infections, flea and parasite infestations, dental disease, obesity, and chronic conditions like kidney disease and diabetes. Treatment varies from parasite prevention and antibiotics to managing diet and providing supportive care, but a veterinarian must diagnose and treat most illnesses. Key prevention methods include regular vet visits, annual vaccinations, parasite prevention, and keeping indoor cats indoors.  </p>

            <p>
*Vaccinate: Keep your cat's vaccinations up to date to prevent serious diseases like FeLV and rabies.</br>
*Annual vet visits: Regular check-ups help catch problems early, especially in senior cats.</br>
*Parasite control: Use regular preventative treatments to protect against fleas, ticks, and worms.</br>
*Maintain a clean environment: Keep your cat's living area, food, and water bowls clean.</br>
