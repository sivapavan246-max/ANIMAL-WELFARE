        <p>Common dog diseases include viral infections like parvovirus and distemper, parasitic infections such as heartworms and intestinal worms, and other conditions like kennel cough, ear infections, and allergies. Prevention through vaccination, regular vet check-ups, and proper nutrition is crucial. Treatment varies by disease, ranging from supportive care and medication for viral infections to preventative medication for parasites. </p>
